# # Data Exfiltration Analysis Lab: Investigating PCAP Traffic
This lab involves analyzing a PCAP file to investigate suspicious network activity and identify data exfiltration. Examining traffic from a compromised host transferring files from a Samba server to an external location.

## Steps and Questions

### 1. Analyze the `network_activity.pcap` File
- Open the PCAP file with Wireshark.
- Use filters and tools to investigate the traffic.

### 2. What is the IP address of the Samba server used to back up files?

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify High-Traffic IPs:** Look for IPs with high packet counts.
2. **Focus on TCP Traffic:** Filter by TCP traffic and port `445` (Samba).
3. **Inspect Communication:** Determine that IP `172.17.0.2` is the Samba server based on file requests.

### 3. How many CSV files were downloaded from the Samba server?

**Explanation:**
1. **Search for CSV Files:** Use Wiresharkâ€™s Find function with `.csv`.
2. **Record File Names:** Note all CSV files found.

### 4. What is the IP address of the host machine used to download the backup files?

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Requests:** The IP making requests to the Samba server is the host machine.

### 5. What protocol was used to exfiltrate data to the external server?

**Explanation:**
1. **Filter Traffic:** Look for FTP or other relevant protocols.
2. **Verify Protocol:** Check for login and file transfers to identify the protocol.

### 6. What is the IP address of the external server?

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Communication:** The external server is the IP communicating with the host.

### 7. What username was used to authenticate to the external server?

**Explanation:**
1. **Search for Username:** Look in the authentication packets.

### 8. What password was used to authenticate to the external server?

**Explanation:**
1. **Locate Password:** Find it within the authentication packets.

### 9. What file name was used to transfer the compressed CSV files to the external server?

**Explanation:**
1. **Find File Name:** Search for the file name in the packets.

## Purpose

The goal of this lab is to practice network traffic analysis and identify data exfiltration techniques.

## Tools Used

- **Wireshark**: For PCAP analysis.
- **tcpdump**: Optional for packet capture.

## Conclusion

Completed the lab by answering the questions based on my analysis of the PCAP file.
